# Robot
This project was done as practice for my JavaScript and CSS skills. In this project, I make a 2D robot using just border lines and text.
## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
## How It Works
The robot's eyes can blink when a button is clicked and can return to normal when that same button is clicked. The background color of the page can also change randomly as another button is clicked.
